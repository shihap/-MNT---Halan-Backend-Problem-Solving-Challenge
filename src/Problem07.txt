1- fill container A from the water source: (A = 5, B = 0)
2- fill container B from container A: (A = 2, B = 3)
3- empty container B: (A = 2, B = 0)
4- pour water from container A into container B: (A = 0, B = 2)
5- fill container A from the water source: (A = 5, B = 2)
6- fill container B from container A: (A = 4, B = 3)
now container A has exactly 4 liters of water !!!!!!!!!!!!
